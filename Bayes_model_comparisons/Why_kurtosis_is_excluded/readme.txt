The kurtosis is excluded because of the non-monotone trends including jumps and high noise. This features are visible in the figures of
the corresponding supplementary material. In this folder the Bayes factors of the kurtosis are summarized for completeness. The Bayes factor
summary of both linear models compared to the constant one is given and the Bayes factor output files of one of the two cases. Note, that 
these Bayes factors cannot be reasonably interpreted and their confusing results can only underline the fact that the kurtosis is not 
a reliable leading indicator in this study.
